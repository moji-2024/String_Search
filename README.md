# String_Search

An efficient implementation of the **Boyer–Moore String Search** algorithm in Python.  
The Boyer–Moore algorithm is known for skipping sections of the text, making it faster than naive search methods, especially for large bodies of text.

## Features
- Fast string matching using Boyer–Moore
- Handles both small and large text inputs efficiently
- Implements bad-character and good-suffix heuristics
- Well-structured and easy-to-read Python code
